NetFlix created a bunch of really useful cloud projects, all of which are Java based.
Steeltoe OSS has made service discovery and a few other integrations available to the
Dotnet community.  One glaring missing feature is an analog for Feign.  This library
intends to fill that gap.  I'm only one guy, so I appreciate any help I can get.

== What will DHaven.Faux do?

Given an interface to a web service with all the Mvc attributes decorating the methods,
DHaven.Faux will generate an implementation that calls the web service for you.  It will
even use Steeltoe.Discovery.Client to resolve the service for you.

Even better, this will be integrated with Microsoft's Dependency Injection framework so
that you only have to add your interface, and Faux will generate the implementation.

The following interface:

----
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Fortune_Teller_UI.Services
{
    [ServiceName("fortuneService")]
    [Route("api/fortunes")]
    public interface IFortuneService
    {
	// GET api/fortunes
	[HttpGet]
        Task<IEnumerable<Fortune>> Get();

	// GET api/fortunes/random
	[HttpGet("random")]
        public Fortune Random();
    }
}
----

Will have all the plumbing done for you so that you can use the service just like
a standard CSharp object.  (Appologies to Steeltoe, I adapted their starter example)


== What does DHaven.Faux do right now?

Not much.  As of 6/22/2017 I just started the project.
As of the last update I can generate the class implementations for simple web services, but plenty of work to be done.  Attempting to figure out Steeltoe Service Discovery so that I can use Eureka to resolve the URL.  This the part I'm stuck on right now.
