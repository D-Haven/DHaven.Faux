NetFlix created a bunch of really useful cloud projects, all of which are Java based.
Steeltoe OSS has made service discovery and a few other integrations available to the
Dotnet community.  One glaring missing feature is an analog for Feign.  This library
intends to fill that gap.  I'm only one guy, so I appreciate any help I can get.

== What will DHaven.Faux do?

Given an interface to a web service with all the Mvc attributes decorating the methods,
DHaven.Faux will generate an implementation that calls the web service for you.  It will
even use Steeltoe.Discovery.Client to resolve the service for you.

Even better, this will be integrated with Microsoft's Dependency Injection framework so
that you only have to add your interface, and Faux will generate the implementation.

The following interface:

----
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Fortune_Teller_UI.Services
{
    [FauxClient("fortuneService")]
    [Route("api/fortunes")]
    public interface IFortuneService
    {
        // GET api/fortunes
        [HttpGet]
        Task<IEnumerable<Fortune>> Get();

        // GET api/fortunes/random
        [HttpGet("random")]
        public Fortune Random();
    }
}
----

Will have all the plumbing done for you so that you can use the service just like
a standard CSharp object.  (Appologies to Steeltoe, I adapted their starter example)


== What does DHaven.Faux do right now?

The foundation is laid to support all the attributes defined in the project.  If something
isn't working, please write up an issue.  Feel free to contribute.

NOTE: it is important that the objects you use in your interface are objects that
NewtonSoft.JSon knows how to serialize. 

== Generated Classes

If you want to enable looking at the generated source code for your implementation,
you will need to add the following to your appsettings.json file:

----
{
  "faux": {
    "debug": {
      "outputSource": true,
      "sourcePath": "./faux-generated"
    }
  }
}
----

* outputSource: true to write the generated classes to the file system
* sourcePath: path to the directory you want the generated classes placed

To prevent naming conflicts between your parameters and internal Faux code,
all Faux variables are prefixed with the Kanji ä»® (kari).  Kari is word
that means "temporary".  When it's used as a prefix it also means "fake".
It seemed fitting to use that particular character with English to represent
internal variables in this project.
